**************************Roberta-XGBoost_ForHateSpeech**************************

This project implements a hybrid Transformer-Ensemble approach for detecting hate speech and offensive language on social media. 
The model leverages the RoBERTa transformer combined with XGBoost to achieve high performance in identifying harmful content.


**Introduction**

Online hate speech detection is critical in combating the spread of harmful content on social media platforms. 
This project uses a novel approach by combining the strengths of RoBERTa (a transformer model) and XGBoost (a gradient boosting algorithm). 
The hybrid model aims to improve classification performance in detecting hate speech across different datasets.


**Datasets**

Datasets Used are:

1. Toxic Tweets Dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/ashwiniyer176/toxic-tweets-dataset"
2. Davidson Dataset "https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1703.04009"
3. Labelled Hate Speech Detection Dataset "https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19686954.v1"


**Model Overview**

RoBERTa: Used for feature extraction. It captures deep semantic representations of text.
XGBoost: Acts as the classifier. It leverages the features generated by RoBERTa to perform accurate predictions.
Hybrid Architecture: Combines the strengths of both models to enhance accuracy and robustness.


**Necessary Libraries**

The following libraries are required to run the project:

1. pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
2. numpy: For numerical computations.
3. nltk: For text preprocessing.
4. torch: The core PyTorch library for working with deep learning models.
5. transformers: For utilizing the RoBERTa transformer model and tokenizers.
6. sklearn: Provides essential tools for data splitting, evaluation metrics, and preprocessing.
7. xgboost: Implements the XGBoost algorithm for classification.



**GPU Resources**

To ensure faster training and implementation, this project leverages GPU resources. 
Utilizing a GPU significantly reduces the processing time for tasks such as feature extraction with RoBERTa and model training.

If a GPU is available, ensure it is enabled in your environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook with CUDA support, or other platforms).
